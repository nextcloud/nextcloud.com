    <h2>In the building</h2>
    <h3>Conference days - Saturday and Sunday</h3>
    <p>Registration opens at 9 and at 10 we start with opening, keynotes and lightning talks in room <code>H1058</code>, 1st floor in the back of the "<em>Hauptgebaude</em>" building. Registration is in front of the keynote room so follow the signs in that direction! After lunch (outside the building, at one of the food trucks) the hacking rooms open. You can find the workshops in the meeting room <code>H3004</code>, with the Nextcloud coding for beginners session in room <code>H3006</code></p>
    <p>See the <a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/schedule">conference program here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Hackathon</h3>
    <p>Friday, registration is at the hacking rooms and opens at 9. Walk from entry to the stairs on the right and follow the signs! This is where we are:
    <ul>
	<li>3th floor:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/friday-focus-enterprise-use-of-nextcloud-at-the-conference/" target="_blank">Friday Focus</a> room <code>H3004</code></li>
		<li>food-and-drink room <code>H3008</code></li>
		<li>the hacking rooms: <code>H3006</code> (<em>starters room</em>), <code>H3007</code></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Of course, coding has to be supported with some calories. In the Mathematik building across the street, all the way to the top and up the stairs one more floor you will find your daily lunch (with your food ticket!) and a great view over the city in the University Math Mensa. During weekdays you can also find a cafe in the main building as well as one in the front of the Mathematics building.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting stuff done and finding who to talk to</h2>
    <p>New to Nextcloud, looking for an introduction or answers about APIs, infrastructure or a pull request?
    <br/> <strong>ask your questions in the <em>starters room</em> <code>H3006</code></strong></p>
    <p>If you want to make sure a certain topic is discussed, make an agreement with the relevant people and book the meeting room. Find a white board on which to do so outside of the meeting room, <code>H3004</code>.</p>

	<h2 class="text-center">For speakers</h2>
	<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	<ul>
	    <ol>1. We will record video and audio. If you're unhappy with that, please let me know and I'll make sure not to publish your video. I won't publish without permission anyway, I'll let you review them before I put them out.</ol>
	    <ol>2. For the Friday talks and the workshops:<br />
		    Room 3005 has space for about 50 people and we'll have a projector ("beamer" for you Germans). If the room is too small we can move to one of the other rooms which have space for 100 people, but I suspect we'll be good as most sessions are mostly interesting for a subset of our contributors.</ol>
	<ol>3. for the lightning talks:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>time</br>
		Aim for roughly 5 minutes. A bit longer is OK, we have some room in the schedule but please don't go beyond 10. Also: if you don't have content for 5 minutes, talk shorter! Shorter is often more stronger. Note that you can and should invite people to talk to you (or join a workshop or meeting later!) to deepen the ideas. The lightning talks are conversation starters!</li>
		<li>Slides<br />
		You can do slides, but they have to be in PDF and you have to get them to me Friday morning the latest. Please, aim for Thursday! I will put them all in one slide deck, in the right order, so we go from one presentation to the next without looking up files or opening folders or changing laptops.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Process<br />
		Saturday, you should sit in the right order in the front row. The 'right order' is the one in the lightning talk track: 
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/program/proposal/53">Saturday</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/program/proposal/54">Sunday</a></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>We start after the keynotes, so please sit there at the beginning of the event! That is at 10:00, at 11 the lightning talks start.</li>
	</ul></ul>
