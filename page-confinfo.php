	<h2 class="text-center">For speakers</h2>
	<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	<ul>
	    <ol>1. We will record video and audio. If you're unhappy with that, please let me know and I'll make sure not to publish your video. I won't publish without permission anyway, I'll let you review them before I put them out.</ol>
	    <ol>2. For the Friday talks and the workshops:<br />
		    Room 3005 has space for about 50 people and we'll have a projector ("beamer" for you Germans). If the room is too small we can move to one of the other rooms which have space for 100 people, but I suspect we'll be good as most sessions are mostly interesting for a subset of our contributors.</ol>
	<ol>3. for the lightning talks:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>time</br>
		Aim for roughly 5 minutes. A bit longer is OK, we have some room in the schedule but please don't go beyond 10. Also: if you don't have content for 5 minutes, talk shorter! Shorter is often more stronger. Note that you can and should invite people to talk to you (or join a workshop or meeting later!) to deepen the ideas. The lightning talks are conversation starters!</li>
		<li>Slides<br />
		You can do slides, but they have to be in PDF and you have to get them to me Friday morning the latest. Please, aim for Thursday! I will put them all in one slide deck, in the right order, so we go from one presentation to the next without looking up files or opening folders or changing laptops.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Process<br />
		Saturday, you should sit in the right order in the front row. The 'right order' is the one in the lightning talk track: 
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/program/proposal/53">Saturday</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/program/proposal/54">Sunday</a></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>We start after the keynotes, so please sit there at the beginning of the event! That is at 10:00, at 11 the lightning talks start.</li>
	</ul></ul>
