    <h2>In the building</h2>
    <h3>Conference days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday</h3>
    <p>Registration opens at 9 and at 9:30 we start with opening, keynotes and lightning talks in room <code>MA004</code>, right in the main hall of the "<em>Mathematiks</em>" building. Registration is in front of the keynote room so you can't miss it! In the weekend lunch is outside at a food truck, during the week it is in the University Mensa at the top floor of the Mathematics building.</p>
    <p>In the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday you can find the workshops on the 1st floor where we also have some food and drinks during breaks, room <code>MA141</code>. The hacking rooms on the 5th floor are open after lunch, too, so you won't be bored!</p>
    <p>Find the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/focus-friday-during-the-nextcloud-conference/">Friday program here</a> and the <a href="https://eventyay.com/e/de88e486/schedule/">Saturday/Sunday program (still in motion) here.</a></p>
    <h3>Hackathon</h3>
    <p>During the rest of the week (Tue-Thur and Mon/Tue) we have our usual hackathon taking place on the 5th floor of the Mathematics building. This is where we are:</p>

	<li>Of course, coding has to be supported with some calories. In the same building, all the way to the top and up the stairs one more floor you will find your daily lunch (with your food ticket!) and a great view over the city in the University Math Mensa. During weekdays you can also find a cafe at the front of the Mathematics building, the Mathe cafe.</li>
    </ul>

	<h2 class="text-center">For speakers</h2>
	<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	<ul>
	    <ol>1. We will record video and audio. If you are unhappy with that, please let me know and I will make sure not to publish your video. I will not publish without permission anyway, I will let you review them before I put them out.</ol>
	    <ol>2. For the Friday talks and the workshops:<br />
		    Room MA141 has space for about 150 people and we will have a projector ("beamer" for you Germans).</ol>
	<ol>3. for the lightning talks:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>time</br>
		Aim for roughly 5 minutes. A bit longer is OK, we have some room in the schedule but please do not go beyond 10. Also: if you do not have content for 5 minutes, talk shorter! Shorter is often more stronger. Note that you can and should invite people to talk to you (or join a workshop or meeting later!) to deepen the ideas. The lightning talks are conversation starters!</li>
		<li>Slides<br />
		You can do slides, but they have to be in PDF and you have to get them to me Friday morning the latest. Please, aim for Thursday! I will put them all in one slide deck, in the right order, so we go from one presentation to the next without looking up files or opening folders or changing laptops.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Process<br />
		Saturday/Sunday, you should sit in the talk order in the front row. <!--The \'right order\' is the one in the lightning talk track:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/program/proposal/53">Saturday</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://conf.nextcloud.com/conference/NextcloudConference2016/program/proposal/54">Sunday</a></li>
		</ul>--></li>
		<li>We start after the keynotes, so please sit there at the beginning of the event! That is at 10:00, at 11 the lightning talks start.</li>
