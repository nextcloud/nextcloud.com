				<div id="gpl" class="collapse">
					<p>Nextcloud is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3, one of the most widely used Open Source license. Written with input from lawyers and industry leaders from all over the world, it is a clear, balanced and well understood license, providing users a level of certainty no license from any single company can give. Today it is a widely used and broadly accepted license across various stakeholders, including developers, users, organizations and large enterprises. The AGPLv3 guarantees that all users of the software can use, study, share and improve the software without any legal risks. Further it's patent clause ensures all users have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license on any patents owned by code contributors now or in the future. On top of this, Nextcloud GmbH guarantees that every customer can use Nextcloud and exercise all rights given by the GNU AGPLv3 without violating any patents or copyright.</p>

				<div class="downarrow"><a href="#sourcerelease" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Do I have to release the source code of systems Nextcloud connects to?<span class="icon-arrow-down"></span></h3></a></div>
				<div id="sourcerelease" class="collapse">
					<p>No. Nextcloud will communicate with your back-end systems over external APIs. Those systems will not become a derivative work of Nextcloud just because they communitcate with it. Therefore you can keep the source code of your back-end systems private and don't have to share it with anyone.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="line"></div>
				<div class="downarrow"><a href="#logos" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Are my logos or the company name affected by the AGPL?<span class="icon-arrow-down"></span></h3></a></div>
				<div id="logos" class="collapse">
					<p>No. Logos, company names, etc. are protected by trademarks. The GNU AGPLv3 is a copyright license and doesn't affect any trademarks. If you put your logo on your Nextcloud it is considered merely as data used by Nextcloud and has no effect on licenses or trademarks.</p></div>
				<div class="line">
				</div>
				<div class="downarrow"><a href="#pubsource" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Do I need to publish the source code if I use Nextcloud?<span class="icon-arrow-down"></span></h3></a></div>
				<div id="pubsource" class="collapse">
					<p>No. As long as you didn't make any modifications to the Nextcloud code, existing apps or write your own apps, you don't have to do anything. Note that configuration does not count as modification! If you did make code modifications, then you have to make that code available under the GNU AGPLv3 or a compatible license to the users of the system. The easiest way to do so is to provide a download link. Nextcloud GmbH assists customers with license compliance.</p>

				<div class="downarrow"><a href="#sellapp" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Can I sell my Nextcloud App?<span class="icon-arrow-down"></span></h3></a></div>
				<div id="sellapp" class="collapse">
					<p>Yes. Nextcloud is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3. This license only defines the rights you have to give the users of the software, but not how they get the software. You can decide freely if you want to sell the software in an app store or through any other channel, or if you want to make the app publicly available. The only requirement is that you license your app under the AGPLv3 or a compatible license.</p>
