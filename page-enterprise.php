		<a href="#why_pay" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Why would I pay for open source software?</h3></a>
		<div id="why_pay" class="collapse">
		<p>Nextcloud is great out of the box. But installing and running a server in a secure and reliable manner and for hundreds or thousands of users, important for a mission critical environment, is not always easy. You probably want access to an expert if something does not function as expected. We provide not only that but also pro-active support with installation and security issues, we reach out when we do feature planning to ensure your needs are served and we support Nextcloud long after you would otherwise be forced to upgrade for security, performance and stability reasons.</p>

		<a href="#sourcerelease" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Do I have to release the source code of systems Nextcloud connects to?</h3></a>
		<div id="sourcerelease" class="collapse">
		<p>No. Nextcloud will communicate with your back-end systems over external APIs. Those systems will not become a derivative work of Nextcloud just because they communitcate with it. Therefore you can keep the source code of your back-end systems private and don't have to share it with anyone.</p></div>

		<a href="#pubsource" data-toggle="collapse"><h3>Do I need to publish the source code if I use Nextcloud?</h3></a>
		<div id="pubsource" class="collapse">
		<p>No. As long as you didn't make any modifications to Nextcloud, make modifications to existing apps or write your own apps, you don't have to do anything. If you did make modifications, then you have to make that code available under the GNU AGPLv3 or a compatible license to the users of the system. The easiest way to do so is to provide a download link. In any case, Nextcloud GmbH is happy to assist you if you need more information on how to distribute your code.</p></div>
