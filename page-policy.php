    <h3><strong>Heads up!</strong> We appreciate every report, however, please notice that our team is very busy and therefore won't respond to reports which we rate as "low" severity or invalid (e.g. DoS in Apache our "X-Powered-By" headers). So do us and yourself a favour: Don't report such things, we will ignore it.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Only test for vulnerabilities on your own install of Nextcloud Server</li>
        <li>Confirm the vulnerability applies to a supported product version</li>
        <li>Share vulnerabilities in detail only with the security team</li>
        <li>Allow reasonable time for a response from the security team</li>
        <li>Do not publish information related to the vulnerability until Nextcloud has made an announcement to the community</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Supported Product Versions</h3>
    <p>See our <a href="<?php echo home_url('security') ?>">Security page</a></p>
    <h3>3rd party apps</h3>
    3rd party app security vulnerabilities should also be reported to the security team. The security team is not responsible for the security of these apps, but will attempt to contact the 3rd party app maintainer and then take proper actions.
