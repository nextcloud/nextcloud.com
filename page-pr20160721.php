<div class="pr"><h1>Beta of Nextcloud 10 with Brute Force Protection, Two-Factor Authentication, Improved Federation and more</h1>

<p><strong>Stuttgart, Germany, July 21, 2016</strong> Nextcloud GmbH, the company behind the next generation privacy-aware open source file sync and share, communication and collaboration technology announces Beta of Nextcloud 10 with groundbreaking security, federation and feature improvements.</p>

<p>Introducing security improvements like brute force protection and support for two-factor authentication, more seamless federation, external storage updates including SMB notifications and usability improvements, this release cements the leading position of Nextcloud as the premier provider of technical progress and innovation in open source file sync and share.</p>

<p>"The Nextcloud 10 release is coming together very well and I'm proud of the work the community and company did together", said Frank Karlitschek, Managing Director, Nextcloud GmbH. "The coming weeks we will finalize and stabilize the server and make it ready for home and enterprise users alike."</p>

<p>With brute force protection, Nextcloud 10 slows down login attempts from potential attackers across IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The new plugin based authentication system supports two-factor authentication and device specific passwords which can be managed by users and sysadmins thanks the ability to revoke active user sessions, a feature compatible with LDAP installations.</p>

<p>"Stability and security are key concerns for Nextcloud users", noted Niels Mache, Managing Director, Nextcloud GmbH. "Extended user testing will give the release time to mature the coming weeks."</p>

<p>Shared links mounted in a Nextcloud server are now treated as federated shares, enabling users to control, change permissions or disable shares irrespective of the continued availability of the shared link itself. Reshared federated shares now create direct connections between servers and the permission support of federated shares is now the same as for normal shares.</p>

<p>The user interface received updates, including support for permanent links in the URL bar which enables sharing URLs between users who have access to the same file or folder work without issues even if they moved the data to a different location on their Nextcloud. External storage now has faster and more reliable Dropbox and Google Drive support and can handle SMB change notifications used in enterprise environments, enabling Nextcloud to be aware of changes on Windows Network Drives without a big performance impact.</p>

<p>More improvements are still being tested before integration in the Nextcloud 10 release. Over the coming weeks the release will be tested and stabilized, a process we invite community members to get involved in. The final stable release is planned for the second half of August.</p>
