<h1>Nextcloud 10 Delivers Secure, Fine Grained Control over Data Access and Workflows</h1>
<p><strong>Stuttgart, Germany, August 24, 2016</strong> Nextcloud GmbH, the company behind the next generation privacy-aware open source file sync and share, communication and collaboration technology announces the immediate availability of Nextcloud 10.</p>

<p>Nextcloud 10 delivers powerful capabilities for system administrators to control and direct the flow of data between users on a Nextcloud server. Rule based file tagging and responding to these tags as well as other triggers like physical location, user group, file properties and request type enables administrators to specifically deny access to, convert, delete or retain data following business or legal requirements. Monitoring, security and performance improvements complement this release, enabling larger and more efficient Nextcloud installations. Users will appreciate a number of usability improvements in the Files app. Nextcloud also makes available this week the official Nextcloud Desktop Client for Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p><em>"The addition of monitoring capabilities to Nextcloud makes a significant difference for system administrators"</em>, noted Tarus Balog, CEO at The OpenNMS Group, Inc. <em>"Gathering in dept performance metrics with tools like OpenNMS is critical for the reliability and performance of large scale deployments"</em></p>

<p><strong>Control over data and workflow</strong><br />
Through File Access Control and automatic file tagging, Nextcloud gives administrators control over data access by enabling them to define strict rules requests need to adhere to. The Workflow engine expands these capabilities, enabling administrators to start any kind of actions based on these triggers. File retention and deletion can also be controlled based on tags set manually or automatically. Combined these features bring unprecedented control over the data flow on a Nextcloud server to administrators, enabling them to ensuring legal or practical requirements can be facilitated or enforced.</p>

<p><em>"If users in certain groups or geographic regions should not be given access to certain file types or if data with a specific tag should not be shared outside the company, administrators can make sure their Nextcloud instance enforces these rules"</em> said Frank Karlitschek, Managing Director of Nextcloud. <em>"such fine grained control over data flow sets Nextcloud apart from competing solutions and explains its attraction for enterprises."</em></p>


<p><strong>Faster and more reliable operation at scale</strong><br />
Nextcloud 10 introduces the Server Information app which provides a way for admins to monitor the health and performance of a Nextcloud system using the web interface or their existing enterprise server monitoring system.</p>

<p>The Samba change notification support improves performance for large Windows Network Drive installations by removing the need for periodic scans of the storage system. Changes the wider external storage system improve performance and introduce UTF-8 support.</p>

<p>Nextcloud 10 delivers plugin based Two Factor Authentication, brute force protection and session management as well as improved support for SAML 2.0 (Shibboleth) authentication.</p>

<p>Further improvements can be found in theming, the Files app and in the introduction of the Nextcloud Desktop Client for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.</p>

<p><em>"Security and privacy continue to be key benefits of Nextcloud"</em>, said Niels Mache, managing director at Nextcloud. <em>"Combined with the peace of mind that comes from a support contract with a real sustainable, open source partner, it explains the fast growth of the Nextcloud user and customer base."</em></p>

<p>Enterprises for whom the availability and performance of their Nextcloud server is critical for business success can get direct access to the engineers who developed all these features through our Enterprise Support Subscription.</p>
