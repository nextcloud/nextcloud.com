<h1>Nextcloud and Partners Announce Education Edition With Moodle, Zenodo and other integration features</h1>

<p><strong>August 2, Stuttgart, Germany.</strong> In collaboration with multiple education and research institutions and software providers Nextcloud GmbH announces the immediate availability of the Nextcloud Education Edition. Built on the successful Nextcloud 12, the Education Edition delivers capabilities highly sought after in the educational market like Moodle and Zenodo integration, ORCID authentication, a Dashboard app and more.</p>

<p><blockquote>The need for secure, self hosted cloud collaboration solutions in the educational and research space is growing. The Education Edition positions Nextcloud as the most integration focused solution in this market.</blockquote>
said Frank Karlitschek, Managing Director of Nextcloud GmbH.</p>

<p>The Nextcloud Education Edition debuts support for file handling integration in learning platform Moodle with an app adapted from work done by Moodle community members at the University of Muenster. In collaboration with the Moodle community and Moodle Pty Ltd, the company behind Moodle, Nextcloud will continue to develop and enhance this integration.</p>

<p><blockquote>I'm excited about the Moodle integration in Nextcloud as part of the Education Edition. We're looking forward to co-operate with Nextcloud on deepening the integration and offering a powerful education and research solution to our users.</blockquote>
said Martin Dougiamas, Founder/CEO at Moodle Pty Ltd.</p>

<p>Together with the Danish cooperative of universities, DeiC, Nextcloud developed the ability to do direct publishing to the popular Zenodo.org shared research publishing platform. DeiC also supported work by Nextcloud on the advanced group management app Circles and was part of an effort to integrate support for ORCID authentication, both of which are included in the Education Edition.</p>

<p><blockquote>Integration with applications commonly used by universities is what sets Nextcloud apart from the competition. The Danish universities will deploy the Education Edition to benefit directly from these capabilities. It continues to be a delight to work with Nextcloud on the next generation file sync and share technology in the educational and research area!</blockquote>
noted Frederik Orellana, lead cloud integration architect at DeiC.</p>

<p>Together with German IT consulting organization regio iT, Nextcloud integrated the Dashboard app which provides users with a easy to use overview of new/changed files, mail, news or calendar events in one place. This Dashboard is already available to the 3000 users at 122 regional schools serviced by ucloud4schools, a regio iT product.</p>

<p><blockquote>Nextcloud provides a powerful base to build additional functionality on. We will continue to extend our product, going beyond what an ordinary cloud can offer.</blockquote>
said Stefan Döhler, project manager at regio iT.</p>

<p>The Education Edition also comes with our native Single Sign On & SAML authentication integration, which is compatible with all web servers and can handle group memberships, flexible session management and app specific passwords. Nextcloud also includes built in support for Oauth2 and through Apache modules, Nextcloud works with Kerberos, OpenID Connect and more. LDAP integration is also standard enabled.</p>

<p>Out of the box Nextcloud Education Edition puts administrators in control, bringing with it Brute Force Protection settings and Password Policy configuration as well as Quota Warning, Admin Notification and Announcement center integration to broadcast announcements from the IT team or university and warn users of running out of storage space.</p>

<p><blockquote>We are looking forward to the capabilities in the Education Edition. Since our successful migration which brought us a 38% decrease in peak database load and a much more responsive user interface, we're planning to move forward with new versions to benefit from the innovations brought to the market by Nextcloud</blockquote>
noted Thomas Hildman, head of IT operations at TU Berlin.</p>

<p>Our innovative Global Scale Architecture, co-developed with partners including TU Berlin, DeiC and others, will become a core
component of the Education Edition in the future.</p>

<p>The Education Edition bundle is available with the Nextcloud 12.0.1 release and can be installed with one click from the Nextcloud app store. We are looking for feedback from universities, schools, research institutions and others on this initial version to direct our future development.</p>

<p>Through a collaboration with Univention, the makers of Univention Corporate Server (UCS), Nextcloud provides an easy to use and ready to go virtual machine image with the Education Edition pre-configured for immediate download.</p>

<p><blockquote>The Nextcloud Education Edition is a perfect fit for a wide range of organizations in research and education. Univention provides a powerful, reliable and easy to administer solution to deploy technology like Nextcloud in schools, universities and other organizations for building up an open, scalable and secure IT infrastructure. So we're happy to work with Nextcloud on bringing their product to this market.</blockquote>
