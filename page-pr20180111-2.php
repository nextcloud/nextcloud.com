<h1>Nextcloud achieves stellar growth in 2017 amid increasing awareness of compliance, control and data security among businesses</h1>
<h3>New and existing regulations like GDPR and HIPAA increase pressure on IT departments to find solutions that keep customer and patient data secure.</h3>

<p><strong>Stuttgart, January 11 2018</strong> – its unique portfolio of privacy-focused self-hosting solutions has propelled Nextcloud to become the vendor with the greatest momentum in the self-hosted Enterprise File Sync and Share market, fueling strong growth over the last year. Today Nextcloud announces an over 7 fold increase of its customer base during 2017 with a corresponding growth of subscription revenue. With market demands changing from simple enterprise file sync and share to collaboration and communication technologies, the introduction of Nextcloud Talk and Nextcloud Groupware today put Nextcloud in a strong position to deliver on the needs of customers.</p>

<p><blockquote>Over the last year, our forward looking and innovative development strategy has been rewarded by the market with a leading position in the area of self-hosted collaboration technology. With at least three more people joining Nextcloud Gmbh this month, we intend to strengthen our position further</blockquote> said Frank Karlitschek, Managing Director at Nextcloud GmbH. <blockquote>While we expand our technological advantage over our competition, customers can expect us to continue to focus on their needs and deliver the expert help that they require.</blockquote></p>

<p>The growth in the self-hosted file exchange and collaboration market combined with increasing regulatory and consumer pressure to protect the integrity, security and privacy of data and the resulting increase in demand for Nextcloud technology has spurred further investments including a doubling of the company to over 35 people. With already over 100 customers and partners active in Europe, North, Central and South America, Asia and Australia, Nextcloud continues to be a healthy and fast growing enterprise. Major customers come from the automotive, banking and finance, manufacturing, services and technology markets as well as government and education. Major examples include SIEMENS, the TU Berlin, Raiffeisen, R+V betriebskrankenkasse, MMEC MANNESMANN and many others.</p>

<p><blockquote>Our customers appreciate expert support from an employee-owned business with a sustainable, organic growth strategy</blockquote> notes Andreas Rode, head of sales at Nextcloud GmbH. <blockquote>We have proven ourselves as a reliable, capable partner, which shows in the growth of our customers, many of whom are signing 3, 4 or 5 year contracts. On this base we expect an accelerating growth of sales in 2018, both within Europe as well as globally.</blockquote></p>

<p>The Nextcloud community growth has continued, with 505 contributors adding 6.6 million lines of code and modifying over 53.000 files in 2017. A total of over 1500 people have contributed code to Nextcloud according to the statistics on OpenHub, part of a healthy ecosystem which has formed around the solution. Over 100 new apps have been created on the Nextcloud app store in 2017, delivering a wide range of features to users at home and in the enterprise. The Nextcloud user base, estimated to be well over 20 million users spread over tens of thousands of Nextcloud servers, has grown to be the largest self-hosted file sync and share community in the world.</p>
