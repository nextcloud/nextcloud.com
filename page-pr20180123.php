<h1>Nextcloud secure file sync and share now available via GEANT and NRENs to educational market</h1>

<p><strong>January 23 2018, Stuttgart</strong> – Nextcloud GmbH, the globally leading supplier of enterprise ready self hosted sync, share and communication technology, joins forces with GÉANT, the pan-European data network for the research and education community, to offer serious pricing benefits to the education market. With solid experience in university specific use cases and large deployments, Nextcloud GmbH will now offer its self hosted, private sync, share and communication technology to any institution interested in providing secure collaboration to their students, researchers and teachers with the highest degree of confidentiality.</p>

<p><blockquote>The National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) and their connected educational institutions  support their students and teachers increasingly often with file sync, share and collaboration technologies. As stewards of their students' data, awareness of the need to stay in control over this data is growing</blockquote> said Peter Szegedi, Senior Cloud Services Manager at GÉANT. <blockquote>Nextcloud is well-positioned to protect the privacy and security of this data with a secure, on-premise, fully featured file sync, share and collaboration platform.</blockquote></p>

<p>Nextcloud GmbH will provide its unique private cloud platform and expertise in the educational and research market at a pricing level fitting university budgets. The GÉANT framework price agreement allows more and more campuses to meet their need for a secure collaboration solution such as Nextcloud. Students will benefit from easy sharing and productivity, assured that their data does not leave the control sphere of the IT team at their university.</p>

<p><blockquote>I am very excited for the opportunity to bring private collaboration technology to even more universities and research institutions</blockquote> said Olivier Paroz, head of Professional Services at Nextcloud GmbH. <blockquote>Our many existing educational customers have shown the security, privacy and productivity benefits of providing a self-hosted solution for student and teacher data.</blockquote></p>

<p>Nextcloud has unique expertise in the education field, as shown by the recent release of the Nextcloud Education Edition, developed in close collaboration with leading education and research institutions in Europe as well as major players in the educational space like Moodle Pty Ltd. Major educational deployments in Europe, Australia, Canada, South Afrika and the USA have shown the significant benefits in terms of productivity, cost and control that are testament to the leading position of Nextcloud in the market.</p>
