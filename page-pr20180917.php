<h1>Rocket.Chat and Nextcloud announce partnership and integration</h1>
<h3>Delivering integrated file exchange in popular communication platform</h3>

<p><em>Berlin/Porto Alegre September 17 2018.</em> Rocket.Chat, the leading on-premises open source communication platform, and Nextcloud, the most popular self-hosted sync, share and collaboration product, announce a new partnership and an integration between their offering.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, engineers at Rocket.Chat and Nextcloud have been collaborating on deep integration of the two solutions, efforts that were first kickstarted by a successful Google Summer of Code project earlier in the year. The integration is now ready and is public from today.</p>

<p>The integration allows users to post files from Nextcloud directly into a chat channel, enabling seamless integration between chat and file handling. By sharing project documents in a project's chat, collaboration is simplified. Home users can easily share pictures or documents with family and friends. More integrations, that go even further than this latest iteration, are in development.</p>

<blockquote>This integration strengthens the strategy that made Nextcloud into the leading on-premises collaboration and communication platform,</blockquote>

said Frank Karlitschek, CEO and founder at Nextcloud GmbH.

<blockquote>As a platform, we aim to provide integration with all relevant products, providing our customers with both choice and flexibility. Rocket.Chat is the perfect addition to Nextcloud and an alternative to Nextcloud Talk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We're glad this integration is available; it's a big step towards creating a comprehensive collaboration ecosystem of open source, decentralised tools,</blockquote>
said Gabriel Engel, CEO and founder of Rocket.Chat.

<blockquote>This is just the beginning, and we are looking forward to hearing from the community about which features we should add to the integration next.</blockquote>

<p>Rocket.Chat and Nextcloud are the perfect combination for those looking for an on-prem, 100% open source, and highly secure collaboration solution.</p>
