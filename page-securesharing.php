			<p>Forrester urges senior corporate management and IT professionals to shift away from ad-hoc solutions like email, outdated technologies like FTP or customer-grade file sync and share. Key requirements for a solution include:
			<ul>
				<li>Enterprise-grade security, with governance and policies to protect valuable content and code</li>
				<li>Ease of use, working in familiar apps such as email to avoid disruption and adoption challenges</li>
				<li>APIs for integration with engineering, support desk, and other essential work processes</li>
			</ul>
			The goal should be to streamline productivity without sacrificing visibility into the distribution of digital knowledge assets.</p>

		<h3>Concerns</h3>
		<p>With 72% of the respondents agreeing with the statement, a key concern cited is the creation of new content silos. Having to migrate data and manage it in a new location, the goals of simplifying work flows while strengthening governance will not be achieved.</p>
		<h3>Current 'solution': email</h3>
		<p>Over half of the teams managed by respondents is reported to use public, consumer grade file sharing services and email to share code, patches and other intellectual property within the organization as well as with customers. Forrester notes that these solutions neither protect intellectual property and competitive advantage but also offer little control or rights management, nor audit and tracking controls.

		<h3>Wherever it is</h3>
		<p>Modern organizations have data in a wide variety of silos like Sharepoint, Windows Network Drives, FTP sites and (often without knowledge of management) Dropbox or Google Drive. Nextcloud acts as a <a class="hyperlink" href="/storage">single file access, sync and share layer</a> across all these storage systems, integrating with enterprise native account handling like LDAP or SAML.</p>
		<h3>Under IT's control</h3>
		<p>No matter the storage solution used, Nextcloud can <a class="hyperlink" href="/workflow">ensure corporate policies are followed.</a> Sharing can be restricted through the file firewall, filtering on user properties like location or group, or file properties like (automatically or manually) assigned tags, file type and more. With storage transparent to users, generic data can remain where it is while IT can make sure that business critical or compliance-relevant information is stored on internal infrastructure and does not leave the company. Use File Drop to let customers upload files to you in a easy and secure way!</p>
