            <p class="section--paragraph">Over half of the teams managed by respondents is reported to use public, consumer grade file sharing services and email to share code, patches and other intellectual property within the organization as well as with customers. Forrester notes that these solutions neither protect intellectual property and competitive advantage but also offer little control or rights management, nor audit and tracking controls.</p>
            <p class="section--paragraph">And indeed, the McAfee survey shows data loss and theft occur regularly. Worse, targetted ransomware attacks are on the rise and the average cost to businesses is growing even faster. Change is needed.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">But introducing a new technology can be disruptive. A key concern cited by 72% of the respondents is the creation of new content silos.

In the last years, the market has been moving on to providing a next generation EFSS, called Content Collaboration Platform, integrating online document editing, communication and planning capabilities complementing the file exchange technologies.</p>
            <p>Nextcloud is a leading vendor in this new space, offering these capabilities with <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('groupware') ?>">Nextcloud Groupware</a> and <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('talk') ?>">Nextcloud Talk</a>, delivering seamless communication features integrated in Files. Users can attach a note to shares, comment on files, open a chat or even start a call directly, connecting files to these conversations to keep track of it all. Integrated email and calendaring connect projects and teams to the files they work with, and with Deck, Nextcloud provides a kanban board app which works together with all those.</p>

            <p>All these functions are available on-the-go and work across organizational boundaries, allowing users to self-manage thanks to built in support for creating guest accounts by users as well as public sharing links that require no login but can be protected by a password.</p>

            <h3>No new data silos</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">Modern organizations have data in a wide variety of silos like Sharepoint, Windows Network Drives, FTP sites and (often without knowledge of management) Dropbox or Google Drive. Nextcloud acts as a <a class="hyperlink" href="/storage">single file access, sync and share layer</a> across all these storage systems, integrating with enterprise native account handling like LDAP or SAML.</p>
            <p class="section--paragraph">That does not exclude using public cloud, nor requires you to give up on data locality. Nextcloud fits perfectly in a hybrid cloud strategy, enabling access to data on Amazon S3 and other public storage technologies. Even cutting-edge Blockchain storage technologies like <a class="hyperlink" href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-joins-storj-labs-to-deliver-decentralized-secure-storage/">Storj.io</a> and Sia.tech are available to augment storage at extremely low cost.</p>
