            <p>Nextcloud is a leading vendor in this new space, offering these capabilities with <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('groupware') ?>">Nextcloud Groupware</a> and <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('talk') ?>">Nextcloud Talk</a>, delivering seamless communication features integrated in Files. Users can attach a note to shares, comment on files, open a chat or even start a call directly, connecting files to these conversations to keep track of it all. Integrated email and calendaring connect projects and teams to the files they work with, and with Deck, Nextcloud provides a kanban board app which works together with all those.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">Modern organizations have data in a wide variety of silos like Sharepoint, Windows Network Drives, FTP sites and (often without knowledge of management) Dropbox or Google Drive. Nextcloud acts as a <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('storage') ?>">single file access, sync and share layer</a> across all these storage systems, integrating with enterprise native account handling like LDAP or SAML.</p>
            <p class="section--paragraph">That does not exclude using public cloud, nor requires you to give up on data locality.

            <p class="section--paragraph">Users can access data on a FTP drive shared with another company; while data stored on an external object storage could be encrypted using server-side encryption so the storage provider has no way to compromise their security.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">Meanwhile, files from the HR department are always enforced to be end-to-end encrypted on their clients, protecting their files from even the worst case of a full server breach.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">In the back-end, IT can use a mix of local NFS or SharePoint storage, public S3 compatible storage and even blockchain technology to find the perfect mix between performance, reliability, security and cost.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">The layered approach to security makes sure users have the maximum amount of productivity in their web interface while making sure sensitive data receives the ultimate protection, client-to-client. Keeping it all in a single solution simplifies management and avoids mistakes from users or IT departments that might cause costly data leaks.</p>
