        <p class="section--paragraph">Forrester urges senior corporate management and IT professionals to shift away from ad-hoc solutions like email, outdated technologies like FTP or customer-grade file sync and share like Dropbox or Google Drive. Key requirements they identify for a solution include:
        <ul>
            <li>Enterprise-grade security, with governance and policies to protect valuable content and code</li>
            <li>Ease of use, working in familiar apps such as email to avoid disruption and adoption challenges</li>
            <li>APIs for integration with engineering, support desk, and other essential work processes</li>
        </ul>
        The goal should be to streamline productivity without sacrificing visibility into the distribution of digital knowledge assets.</p>

            <h3>Current 'solution': email</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">Over half of the teams managed by respondents is reported to use public, consumer grade file sharing services and email to share code, patches and other intellectual property within the organization as well as with customers. Forrester notes that these solutions neither protect intellectual property and competitive advantage but also offer little control or rights management, nor audit and tracking controls.</p>
            <h3>Concerns about new technologies</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">But introducing a new technology can be disruptive. A key concern cited by 72% of the respondents is the creation of new content silos. Having to migrate data and manage it in a new location, the goals of simplifying work flows while strengthening governance will not be achieved.</p>

        <h2>Future-ready: built in collaboration</h2>
        <p>Gartner typically calls solutions in this space Enterprise File Sync and Share or EFSS. In the last years, the market has been moving on to providing a next generation EFSS, called Content Collaboration Platform, integrating online document editing, communication and planning capabilities complementing the file exchange technologies.</p>
        <p>Nextcloud is a leading vendor in this new space, offering these capabilities with <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('groupware') ?>">Nextcloud Groupware</a> and <a class="hyperlink" href="<?php echo home_url('talk') ?>">Nextcloud Talk</a>, delivering seamless communication features integrated in Files. Users can attach a note to shares, comment on files, open a chat or even start a call directly, connecting files to these conversations to keep track of it all. Integrated email and calendaring connect projects and teams to the files they work with, and with Deck, Nextcloud provides a kanban board app which works together with all those.</p>
        <p>All these functions are available on-the-go and work across organizational boundaries, allowing users to self-manage thanks to built in support for creating guest accounts by users as well as public sharing links that require no login but can be protected by a password.</p>

            <h3>No new data silos</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">Modern organizations have data in a wide variety of silos like Sharepoint, Windows Network Drives, FTP sites and (often without knowledge of management) Dropbox or Google Drive. Nextcloud acts as a <a class="hyperlink" href="/storage">single file access, sync and share layer</a> across all these storage systems, integrating with enterprise native account handling like LDAP or SAML.</p>

With storage transparent to users, generic data can remain where it is while IT can make sure that business critical or compliance-relevant information is stored on internal infrastructure and does not leave the company.

Together with the support for nearly any storage technology, it features server-side encryption and offers the ability to employ <a href="/endtoend">end-to-end, client side encryption</a> for a subset of user files. Rather than making it an either-or choice, your business can rely on utmost security where it is needed but keep collaborative online document editing and full-text search on the server over the rest of the stored data.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">Users can access data on a FTP drive shared with another company; while data stored on an external object storage could be encrypted using server-side encryption so the storage provider has no way to compromise their security.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">Meanwhile, files from the HR department are always enforced to be end-to-end encrypted on their clients, protecting their files from even the worst case of a full server breach.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">The layered approach to security makes sure users have the maximum amount of productivity in their web interface while making sure sensitive data receives the ultimate protection, client-to-client. Keeping it all in a single solution simplifies management and avoids mistakes from users or IT departments that might cause costly data leaks.</p>
